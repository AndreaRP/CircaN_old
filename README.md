# CircaN

Nonlinear least squares model for accurate detection of circadian gene expression.

## Setup
If you don't already have, download and install the devtools package.

```
install.packages("devtools") 
```
Then, install CircaN from github directly to R.
```
library("devtools")
install_github("AndreaRP/CircaN")
```

## Running CircaN

To help you get an idea of the type of data CircaN uses as input, we have included a toy dataset with 200 features, 
along with it's metadata file in the package.

```
library("CircaN")
```
Load expression data and metadata and run circan function.
```
expression_example <- CircaN::expression_example
metadata_example <-CircaN::metadata_example

p <- circan(data=expression_example, s2c=metadata_example)
```


This will run CircaN algorithm on your data with default parameters. Depending on your analysis you may want to change
those to fit your needs. You can sepcify:

* data: Dataframe containing the expression data. Samples must be in columns and genes in rows. For an example see data(expression_example).
* s2c: Dataframe containing the metadata for the samples. Must have at least a 'sample' column with the sample name as it appears in the data matrix; a 'time' column with the time point the sample was collected; and an 'ind' column containing information for the individual the sample comes from. For an example see data(metadata_example).
* shiny: Is the package running in a shiny app? default to FALSE.
* mode: Algorithm to use in the NLS regression. Must be one of 'default' for Gauss-Newton, 'plinear' for the Golub-Pereyra algorithm for partially linear least-squares models and 'port' for the ‘nl2sol’ algorithm from the Port library. Default is default. See nls documentation for extended info.
* init_value: Initial value for the period. Default is set to 24.
* max_per: Maximum period to regress. Default is set to Inf.
* min_per: Minimum period to regress. Default is set to -Inf.
